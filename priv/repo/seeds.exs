He did an adequate job at first, not really tested. He ran OK for a big, corner guy. He seemed to be relaxed and had fun, into the game when  on the bench, but he was focused, agg and intense in the batters box. He didn't get me excited, he did hit 1 long HR to RF, he could be a pot platoon 1B, or more likely a LH bat off the bench or DH, with an occ game at 1B. He seemed to have some issues getting overpowered by power arms.",
